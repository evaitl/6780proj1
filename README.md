# 6780proj1
CSCI6780 (Dist Systems) project 1


Only needs to work on a linux box. This works on my linux box, but I haven't tested
on nike yet. 

Type "make". This should create myftp and myftpserver shell scripts that reference 
the created client.jar and server.jar. 

Please type "make indent" before checking in if you do a lot of changes. If
you would like different formatting, please edit the docs/uncrustify.cfg.
